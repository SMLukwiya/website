# Vault Runtime

**A self-hosted, edge-native runtime built for immutability, security, and control.**

Vault Runtime is an open-source edge runtime built from scratch in C.
It is designed for operators and teams who want deep control over how functions
are deployed, executed, and secured — without relying on opaque managed platforms.

> **Status:** alpha1  
> Exploratory, incomplete, and intentionally transparent.

## Why Vault Runtime?

Modern edge platforms are powerful, but they hide critical decisions behind
managed control planes and generic servers.

Vault Runtime takes a different approach:

- Build close to the kernel
- Make performance trade-offs explicit
- Treat immutability as a first-class concept
- Give operators real control

This project exists to explore what an edge runtime looks like
when **security, cold-start performance, and correctness** are not abstractions,
but design constraints.

## What works today (alpha1)

### Server & networking
- Custom edge-native server written in C
- HTTP/2 only
- TLS 1.3 using picotls and minSSL
- Pure epoll-based event loop
- Explicit control over:
  - epoll wait strategy
  - request intake per tick
  - prioritization of short-lived requests

### Control plane
- CLI to:
  - start/stop the daemon
  - start/stop the server
  - check server status
  - deploy functions
- Daemon coordinating CLI and server
- YAML-based configuration for server and functions

### Configuration & deployment
- Event-driven, streaming YAML parser
- Early termination for large configs
- Deep validation with precise line/column error reporting
- Custom binary blob format:
  - combines function config and code
  - optimized for fast parsing
  - O(1) access to sections via precomputed tables

### Routing & execution
- Radix tree for deployed and active routes
- Explicit separation between deploy and activate
- Verified function invocation via nghttp2

## What “edge-native” means in Vault Runtime

- Cold-start performance is a first-class concern
- Short-lived requests are prioritized explicitly
- No hidden control plane
- No implicit lifecycle transitions
- Immutable artifacts by design
- Built close to the kernel, not layered on top of generic servers

---

## Version 1 goals

Version 1 focuses on being a complete, honest, self-hosted edge runtime.

### Planned for v1
- Daemon configuration isolated from server configuration
- Daemon key generation and secure storage
- Lightweight CLI authentication
- Encryption of function artifacts and configs at rest
- Load-aware epoll wait tuning
- JavaScript execution via QuickJS
- Support for:
  - fetch
  - timers
  - logging
- Explicit function lifecycle management

### Explicitly out of scope for v1
- WASM support (planned for later)
- HTTP/1.x compatibility
- Managed SaaS control plane
- Opaque autoscaling or hidden scheduling logic

---

## Project philosophy

Vault Runtime favors:
- Explicit over implicit
- Control over convenience
- Transparency over abstraction
- Correctness over generality

If something is slow, unsafe, or complex — it should be visible.

## Looking for feedback

Vault Runtime is an early, opinionated system.

If you’ve built:
- servers
- runtimes
- CDNs
- edge platforms
- or low-level infrastructure

your feedback is especially welcome.

Issues, discussions, and architectural critique are encouraged.
